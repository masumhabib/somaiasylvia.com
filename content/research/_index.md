In accordance with Mooreâ€™s Law, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect 
transistors (FETs) have experienced steady, exponential downsizing of their critical dimensions. 
My research interests include modeling and simulation of nano-scale devices. I 
have been doing theoretical research throughout my career as a PhD student. 
Until now, it has been a wonderful experience for me to learn at least a few 
things from the &#8216;gigantic&#8217; world of &#8216;nano&#8217;.
