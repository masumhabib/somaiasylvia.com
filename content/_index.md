Hi there, Sylvia here! Thank you for visiting my **personal** website.  

I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of California- Riverside (UCR). 
I worked as a Research Assistant at the LAboratory for Terascale and Terahertz 
Electronics (LATTE) with Prof. Roger Lake. I received my PhD degree in March of 2014. 
Before coming to UCR, I got my BSc and MSc degrees in Electrical and Electronic 
Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh.

My research interests include modeling and simulation of nano-scale devices. I 
have been doing theoretical research throughout my career as a PhD student. 
Until now, it has been a wonderful experience for me to learn at least a few 
things from the &#8216;gigantic&#8217; world of &#8216;nano&#8217;.

Thanks again for your time and interest. I hope you enjoy my website.
